# BlueSky_Co2

You have been approached by Blue Sky Development and have been asked to develop an Android mobile version of their personal CO2 footprint calculator.
Using the React Native framework, your task is to develop a personal CO2 footprint calculator app for Android branching off the existing JavaScript
code to calculate a user's CO2 footprint based on their lifestyle.

- Input values for various aspects of their lifestyle, for example: Diet, different commute methods, recycling, how much heating they use, their holiday habits and more
- View their CO2 footprint calculated as a total average which is calculated against real world data.
- Update the values to see the effect on their CO2 footprint.
- View the CO2 footprint data in a visually engaging manner.

To run the App require React Native & Expo so once Installed Npm I to add modules then Npm Start will bring up Metro Bundler where you can either Run in Browser, 
Use an Emulator or Scan QR Code and run using Expo Go App.
